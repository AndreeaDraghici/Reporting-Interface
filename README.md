The application is divided into 4 parts. We worked using an Arduino UNO development board, then we collected the data stored in a text file after formatting the data on the serial port in json. Then the database was made for its connection with the interface and the RAPP / STAPP part. Then an intermediate application was created that connects the RI interface to the database and performs certain filters according to the client's requirements.
